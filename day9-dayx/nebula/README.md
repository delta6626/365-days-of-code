# Nebula â€“ The Free and Open Source Note-Taking App

## ðŸ“¢ Important Announcement

Nebula now lives in its own dedicated [GitHub repository](https://github.com/delta6626/nebula).

What started as a small project on Day 9 of my #365DaysOfCode challenge has grown into something truly special, at least for me. Nebula has evolved significantly, and itâ€™s time it had a space of its own. All further developments will take place in the new repository.

Check it out, explore the code, and feel free to contribute.
