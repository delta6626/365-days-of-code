# ðŸ’» 365 Days of Code

Hi! I'm coding every day for a year. Starting off with very simple tech like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and slowly moving on to more advanced stuff.

---

## ðŸ“… How it works

- One folder per day
- Each folder has the code I wrote that day
- Just practicing, experimenting, and learning new things
