# ðŸ’» 365 Days of Code

Hi! I'm coding every day for a year. Starting off with very simple tech like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and slowly moving on to more advanced stuff.

## ðŸ“… How it works

- One folder per day  
- Each folder has the code I wrote that day  
- Just practicing, experimenting, and learning new things

## âœ… Progress

I'll try to update this as I go.

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

This is mainly for me to stay consistent and track my growth. Feel free to look around!
