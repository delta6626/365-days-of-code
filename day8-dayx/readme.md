# 📝 Simple Task Manager

A lightweight, no-framework task manager built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Tasks are stored in LocalStorage, so everything stays on your device—no backend, no signups, just fast and simple task tracking.

## 🚀 Features

- Add tasks  
- Mark tasks as completed or pending  
- Soft delete (moves tasks to Recycle Bin)  
- Permanently delete tasks from Recycle Bin  
- LocalStorage-based (your data stays in your browser)  
- Clean UI using [Lucide Icons](https://lucide.dev/)

## 📂 File Structure

- `index.html` – Main HTML file  
- `styles.css` – All styles for the app  
- `script.js` – JavaScript for logic and interactions  
- `assets/` – (Optional) Folder for screenshots or icons
